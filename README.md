This repository holds all the code developed for an Operating Systems class (SOPE) @ MIEIC, FEUP. Made in collaboration with [@antonioalmeida](https://github.com/antonioalmeida).

Please refer to branch ``second-project`` to find the source code, system rules and implementation details.
There is also a ``first-project`` branch holding a small introduction project where we partially implemented UNIX's *find* utility. Once again, more details in the branch's README.
